The NBA.package houses functions that enable easy creation of standardised graphs, plots and maps for SANBI's National Biodiversity Assessment (NBA) content.

## Installation

You can install the development version of NBA.package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
#devtools::install_github("SANBI-NBA/NBA.package")
```

## Usage

The package is intended for use in r and quarto by the NBA team to assist with the creation of the NBA website pages and reports. The goal of the functions is to simplify the processes of cretaing plots, tables, and maps in the reports and to standardise the outputs of all realms. 



## Data

The data used should be read in from csv's, excel documents, or sql (or created within r). The data structure accepted by the functions are explained in the help files of each function. There are also a number of example datasets to help users understand and visually see the required data structure. Please refer to the help files and vignettes for these example datasets. 
Having extra columns in not a problem for the functions as they are mostly bulit with the ability to select the columns you wish to use in the function. 

Along with the example datasets there is a list of all possible names to be used in the categories columns (**NBA_categories**), please pay attention to spelling and cases as the functions are case sensitive. The categories examples are 'Well Protected' or 'Least Concern', and are used to assign the correct colours to the correct categories.  

## Issues

If you find any issues with the package or functions, or if you have any suggestions for improvements to the package please go to the git repository and log an issue so it can be dealt with.
