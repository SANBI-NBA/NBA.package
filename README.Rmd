The goal of the NBA.package is to allow all graphs/ plots/ and maps created for the NBA to be created easily with targeted functions that enable ease of use and standardisation of results.

## Installation

You can install the development version of NBA.package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
#devtools::install_github("SANBI-NBA/NBA.package")
```

## Data

All data should be in a standard format where the groups/variables (e.g. Functional
ecosystem types/ taxa) are listed in the first column, and the threat status/ protection
level ect categories are in subsequent columns. There is no need to have a totals column. 
Having extra columns in not a problem, as long as you have the columns mentioned. 

There are three example datasets in this package that can be use as references (NBA_example_bar_plot, NBA_example_RLI_plot, and NBA_example_donut_plot) as well as
a list of all possible names to be used in the categories columns (NBA_categories), please pay attention to spelling and cases as the functions are case sensitive.

## Issues

If you find any issues with the package or functions, or if you have any suggestions for improvements to the package please go to the git repository and log an issue so it can be dealt with.
