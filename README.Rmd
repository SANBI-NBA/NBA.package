# NBA.package

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of the NBA.package is to allow all graphs/ plots/ and maps created for the NBA to be created easily with targeted functions that enable ease of use and standardisation of results.

## Installation

You can install the development version of NBA.package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("TashBes/NBA.package")
```



You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.
